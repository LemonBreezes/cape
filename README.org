* Introduction

Cape provides a bunch of Completion At Point Extensions which can be used in
combination with my [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]] completion UI or the default completion UI. You can
register the ~cape-*-capf~ functions in the ~completion-at-point-functions~ list.
This makes the corresponding completion backends available to the
~completion-at-point~ command, which is usually invoked by pressing ~TAB~ or ~M-TAB~.
Furthermore there are a handful of dedicated completion commands ~cape-*~, which
you can bind directly to a key in your user configuration.

* Configuration

Cape is work in progress and should be installed manually. I have not yet
decided where the package is going to land. Ideally some of the Capfs provided
by this package should be upstreamed into Emacs itself.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Enable Corfu completion UI
  ;; See the Corfu README for more configuration tips.
  (use-package corfu
    :init
    (corfu-global-mode))

  ;; Add extensions
  (use-package cape
    ;; Bind dedicated completion commands
    :bind (("C-c p p" . completion-at-point) ;; capf
           ("C-c p d" . dabbrev-completion)  ;; dabbrev
           ("C-c p t" . complete-tag)        ;; etags
           ("C-c p f" . cape-file)
           ("C-c p k" . cape-keyword)
           ("C-c p a" . cape-abbrev)
           ("C-c p s" . cape-ispell)
           ("C-c p w" . cape-dict))
    :init
    ;; Add `completion-at-point-functions', used by `completion-at-point'.
